# Armor Trims
I decided that I would backportport Armor Trims from 1.20 before somebody else did, so here we are.  
Features:
- Very Configuable (too configuable?)
- Compatibility coming soon (I think).
- Untrim armor with shears.
- JEI Support (Hopefully)
- Other stuff I guess.  
I don't know how to mod so bugs are bound to happen.  
Other than that this mod is still WIP and so is this Readme, but hopefully that changes soon.
